We achieved an accuracy of 89% using flavia leaf dataset.
The way to this process is : 
1.Firstly we have to download flavia leaf dataset.
2.secondly we have to  convert the dataset into csv file i.e, Flavia_features.csv(preprocess_extract_dataset.ipynb).
3.followed by image background subtraction(image_background_subtraction.ipynb).
4.then pre processing the images(pre_processing.ipynb)
5.finally the classifying will be done(classify_leaves_flavia.ipynb)
